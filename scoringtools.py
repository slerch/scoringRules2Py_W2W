"""
Interface for some functionality of the R-package scoringRules.
It computes univariate and multivariate scores of the form *S(y, dat)*, 
where *S* is a proper scoring rule, *y* is a *d*-dimensional realization vector 
and *dat* is a simulated sample of forecasts. Available are the continuous
ranked probability score (CRPS), energy score and variogram score of order *p*.
